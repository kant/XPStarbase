## Blender Models

I consider myself a blender novice still. The majority o0f my models are static (unanimated) mesh models created for X-Plane scenery. I am just starting into modeling with curves. I am also moving deeper into texturing so overall my models are pretty straight forward so far.

### Overview

There are a lot of models of wide ranging complexity. Some are part of larger objects and some models represent complete structures.
