## Site Images and Planning Figures
 
This consists of screen shots and diagrams and some photos obtained during development to plan and monitor the appearance of the scenery. Included are renders from blender of objects created for import into X-Pane with the World Editor.

I have been guided by the aerials of [RGV Aerial Photography](https://www.patreon.com/RGVaerial) and I encourage you too to support him on Patreon. The detail has grown at the rate of his fly-overs. I have taken some liberties and moved ahead with some structure according to the [plans](https://github.com/medmatix/XPStarbase/blob/main/images/Launch%20SIte%20Future%20map.png) originally filed with the state and county. I have at times included in the screenshots a fictious airfield I land and takeoff from to do screenshots and debugging. You will not find it in the package distribution.
