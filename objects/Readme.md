## X-Plane Objects



### Overview

These are Blender or other models exported to X-Plane / WED obj-8 format. The textures applicable are in the Textures folder and must be installed in the same directory with the obj files. A growing number of draped polygons (.pol) are included here created as needed.

I began using [AC3D](https://www.inivis.com/xplane.html) to build models for export, with the plugin ([ac3d_plugin_win_321r2](https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/ac3d-plugin/)) but have switched for most of my modeling to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [Xplane2Blender](https://github.com/X-Plane/XPlane2Blender) plugin. Occasionally I do pre-design constructions with [FreeCAD]()https://www.freecadweb.org/. 

I believe in and support [open source software](https://opensource.org/) whenever I can.

### Descriptions and Use

These objects my be inspected individually using the objView utility which is part of the [XPTools](https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/xptools/) package.
