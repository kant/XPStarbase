## Current Scenery Package



### Overview

You are welcome to download, use and improve any objects and location scenery here but use is at your own risk. No warranty is implied whatso ever  and these sets.

There are a number of external library dependencies at this time; the most stable being [OpenSceneryX](https://www.opensceneryx.com/), [NAPS Library](https://www.x-plained.com/), [waves library](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/25439-waves-library/) and [others](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/search/&tags=library) which are poorly documented here at this time. I Thank the creators of  all these libraries. In order to submit to the Scenery Gateway the  objects used must be moved inside the package - which will simplify  getting all the objects needed.

### Installation

Simply extract the SpacexBC 1 and SpacexBC2 zip files into a directory called, 'SpaceX - Boca Chica' in the  <..\X-Plane 11\Custom Scenery> directory of your X-Plane install directory.  The probable dependencies are enumerated above and s/b themselves unpacked already into the Custom Scenery directory. In general missed library sources will simply result in the objects therefrom not showing in the Site scenery.

I have not used ortho real scenery at this time so Orth4XP is not yet a requirement for my project. Hopefully this will change as I learn to use such libraries in my development.

### Discussion 

The Spacex Boca Chica scenery is and on going development at this time and this directory contains the current version I've tested on my own X-Plane. As I said, I make no guarantees or warranties about it at all, but it is straightforward enough I'm sure anyone can troubleshoot of alter it as needed.

From time to time objects my come and go as I experiment with things Elon and the Space Twitter talks about. Once it is built however it should be there to stay but even SpaceX tears things down or replaces them from time to time.

If I cease to be involved in the development I promise to post that here and anyone can pick it up accordingly. I welcome suggestions (which I may or may not get to) and feedback (which I may or may not attend to). Trolls will be ignored, or worse.
